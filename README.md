## General Info
This project is a weather application. It uses openweather's API to determine the weather of a specified location. The default is set to Washington DC but can be changed when a user searches for a new city. The cities that are searched are stored in local storage and buttons are dynamically created for each city. Clicking on the city buttons will give you the forecast for that corresponding city. 

## Roadblocks
I ran into several roadblocks with this code but I was able to overcome all obstacles and have a fully functional final product. The biggest struggles for me were organizing and formatting my code for easier readability and styling the layout. I had difficulty putting elements where they were supposed to go, and even then my final product isn't perfect. The API portion I'm glad to say gave me very little issue, that part came naturally for me. Overall this project was very useful in better understanding APIs and how URLs work.
